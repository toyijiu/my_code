#110. Balanced Binary Tree

------

#题目
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

        //高度差超过1
        if(abs(rightHeight - leftHeight) > 1)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        return max(leftHeight,rightHeight) + 1;

    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        //思路：深度遍历
        return getDfsHeight(root) != -1;
    }
