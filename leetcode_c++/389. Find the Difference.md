##思路

和异或那道题一个思路，分别异或两个string的各个char，最后剩的就是那个多的char

------

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        //分别异或各个char，最后剩下的就是多的char
        char result = 0;
        for(size_t i = 0;i < s.size();i++)
        {
            result ^= s[i];
            result ^= t[i];
        }
        
        result ^= t[s.size()];
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
