#62. Unique Paths

------

##题目

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 3 x 7 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

##思路

这道题的本质就是从m+n个数中取min(m,n)个，求个数，就是高中学的数学，C(m+n,min(m,n))

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        //其实就是高中学的数学题（m+n）个中选n个c(m+n,min(m,n)),注意m和n要减一
        m--;
        n--;

        int min = m > n?n:m;
        long big = 1;
        long small = 1;
        for(int i=m+n;i >= m+n-min+1;i--)
        {
            big *= i;
        }
        for(int i=1;i<=min;i++)
        {
            small *= i;
        }

        return big/small;
    }
};
```
