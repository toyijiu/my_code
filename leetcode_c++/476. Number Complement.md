##题目

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:

    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

##思路

求出num的掩码，掩码取反与num的反码位于，就把num反码高位没用的1置0了

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        //求出num的掩码，掩码取反，再和num的反码位于
        int mask = ~0;
        while(num & mask)
        {
            mask <<= 1;
        }
        
        return ~mask & ~num;
    }
};
```
