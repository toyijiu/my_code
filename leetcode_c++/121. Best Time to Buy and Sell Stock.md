#121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

------

##题目

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example 1:

Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)

Example 2:

Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

##思路

遍历，依次找到到目前为止最小的值，在比较当前值-最小值和之前保存的计算的最小差值的最大值

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if(prices.size() == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int minNum = prices[0];
        int maxNum = 0;

        for(size_t i = 0;i < prices.size();i++)
        {
            minNum = min(prices[i],minNum);
            maxNum = max(maxNum,prices[i] - minNum);
        }

        return maxNum;

    }
};
```
