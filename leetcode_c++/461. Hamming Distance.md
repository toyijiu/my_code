##题目

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int result = x ^ y;
        int num = 0;
        while(result)
        {
            num++;
            result &= (result-1);
        }
        
        return num;
    }
};
```
