##题目

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

##思路

循环求happyNum，退出条件是为1返回true，数字重复形成循环则返回false

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

    int getHappyNum(int num)
    {
        int result = 0;
        
        while(num)
        {
            result += pow(num%10,2);
            num /= 10;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        if(n <= 0)
        {
            return false;
        }
        
        vector<int> numFlag;
        numFlag.push_back(n);
        
        while(n)
        {
            n = getHappyNum(n);
            if(n == 1)
            {
                return true;
            }
            //形成循环了
            if(find(numFlag.begin(),numFlag.end(),n) != numFlag.end())
            {
                return false;
            }
            numFlag.push_back(n);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
