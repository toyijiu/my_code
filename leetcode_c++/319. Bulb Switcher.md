##题目

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

Example:

Given n = 3. 

At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

##思路

- 就是判断每个数因式分解的个数，这个个数就是它会拨动开关的次数，偶数次则最后结果还是关闭，奇数次就是打开
- 质数只有1和他本身，所以最后为off
- 合数要想总的因数为奇数，那么肯定有两个因式一样，即这个数肯定是这个相等因式的平方
- 所以本题就是求k^2<=n中k的个数

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {    
         return sqrt(n);
   
    }
};
```
