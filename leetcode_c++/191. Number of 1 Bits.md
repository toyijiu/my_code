##题目

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

##思路

n&(n-1)会把n最后的一个bit为1的改成0，循环遍历计算bit 1的个数

------

##代码

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        while(n)
        {
            sum++;
            n &= (n-1);
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
